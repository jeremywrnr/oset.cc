## generic ordered sets

Since the lists are sorted, we can create O(N) solutions to intersection,
union, and difference operations between sets that are sorted the same way. The
programmer can provide a comparator function to sort the lists. An example of
this is given is shown below in the test code. If a list is copied, then the
comparator from the last list is used.
